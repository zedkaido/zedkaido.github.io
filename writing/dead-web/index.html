				<p>
					As I sit here writing this very website in <a href="https://vanilla-js.com/"> vanilla.js</a>, I realized I don't actually know HTML and JS, or at least not in the true sense - the way it was designed to be used. I forgot it a long time ago when I was persuaded into the daringly unquestionable land of frameworks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, don't get me wrong: These frameworks are <b>great</b>! They do everything <b>for you</b>! And perhaps that's the problem.  You need a link changed? <b>PIECE OF CAKE!</b> - just change a router path or something like it and your component &ldquo;Page&rdquo; will now be served on a new link.  Do you see the problem?
				</p>
				<p>
					As it turns out, when writing a pure HTML website you have to be explicit about every path. HTML Pages live inside directories, so it is intrinsically harder to change a link, and thus to break a link.
