						Download Discontinued <code>Android File Transfer.app</code> by Google 
					</a>

				<p>
					Another day, another product discontinued by Google ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
				</p>
				<p>
					Android File Transfer is no more. It has ceased to be. It expired and has gone to meet it's maker.
				</p>
				<p>
					As it turns out, this one is actually quite useful. Not perfect, but useful. It allows you to transfer files between an Android device and a Macintosh computer. 
				<p> 
					Now, there are other apps that achieve the same thing and much more, but they all seem quite bloated compared to the relativelly lightweight 3.5MB app by Google.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckilly, Google hasn't taken down the download link:<br> <a href="https://dl.google.com/dl/androidjumper/mtp/current/AndroidFileTransfer.dmg">https://dl.google.com/dl/androidjumper/mtp/current/AndroidFileTransfer.dmg</a> so, download it while you can ツ.

				As an alternative, you can also use <code>adb</code> in the terminal: <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/adb">https://developer.android.com/tools/adb</a>
