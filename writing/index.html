				"Negativity is the enemy of creativity.",
				"Growth starts when you start doing the things you're not qualified to do.",
				"When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace.",
				"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.",
				"When you tear a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you are telling the world that you fear what he might say.",
				"I would hate to lose out on becoming a better version of me.",

				"If you sit down and write quietly the whole day, you'll have written two or three pages, even if it's a struggle. And if you keep at it, you'll eventually have a couple hundred pages. I think young people today don't know the trick of it. They start and want to get to the end right away. When you go mountain climbing, the first thing you're told is not to look at the peak but to keep your eyes on the ground as you climb. You just keep climbing patiently one step at a time. If you keep looking at the top you'll get frustrated. I think writing is similar. You need to get used to the task of writing.

				"No rules are universal (except this one).",
				"Those who would be gods refashion themselves into images the vieweres would have them be",
				"If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.",
				"Competitive Programming is like solving a riddle. Software engineering is like solving a murder.",
